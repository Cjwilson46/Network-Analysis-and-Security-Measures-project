Network Analysis and Security Measures

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of network communication processes and security protocols across various scenarios. It explores how data transfer occurs from the application to the transport layer, detailing processes such as file submission to Dropbox, accessing Yahoo mail, purchasing on Amazon, and updating personal information securely. Each scenario highlights the importance of protocols like TCP, NAT, IMAP, and HTTPS, and addresses the transition from private to public IP addresses for internet access.

Key security measures like error checking, port usage, and encryption are discussed to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The document also delves into potential security threats at different OSI model layers and suggests mitigation strategies such as firewall configurations, traffic filtration, and two-factor authentication to protect against attacks like SQL injection, DDoS, IP spoofing, and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).
